Mission:		Our mission is to create a well-known local resource for individuals that are looking for assistance with the daily needs of life and/or in times of crises. We’re assisting people to acquire what they need from their community at all times, but especially when tragedy strikes. People may connect to deliver goods, give/get rides to appointments or other important tasks, or utilize the barter and trade page to exchange one type of item for another.


Vision:			helpMEhelpU is our non-profit organization that has an easy-to-navigate website providing visitors with help during times of need. hMhU will cater to people within the vicinity of approximately 30 miles of the Phoenix Metro Area. We’ll be helping them connect with other people who can offer a variety of different items and/or services provided for a non-monetary exchange. Our idea stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic, to assist people in obtaining items/services needed at the time of crises in exchange for items they have at their disposal. Here at hMhU we understand that people are often willing to come together and help each other, therefore we are connecting them with available resources in their communities.
